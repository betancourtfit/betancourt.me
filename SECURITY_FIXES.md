# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

## Summary
Successfully resolved all security vulnerabilities in the betancourt.me project on branch `cursor/fix-vulnerability-in-isolate-branch-bd81`.

## Vulnerabilities Resolved

### 1. CVE-2025-5889 - brace-expansion ReDoS (Low Severity)
- **Issue**: Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability in brace-expansion versions 1.0.0 - 1.1.11 || 2.0.0 - 2.0.1
- **Fix**: Automatically resolved via `npm audit fix`
- **Resolution**: Updated to secure version via dependency resolution

### 2. CVE-2025-49005 - Next.js Cache Poisoning (Low Severity) 
- **Issue**: Cache poisoning vulnerability due to omission of the Vary header in Next.js versions 15.3.0 - 15.3.2
- **Fix**: Automatically resolved via `npm audit fix`
- **Resolution**: Updated Next.js to version 15.3.5

### 3. CVE-2024-53382 - PrismJS DOM Clobbering (Moderate Severity)
- **Issue**: DOM Clobbering vulnerability in PrismJS versions < 1.30.0
- **Affected Path**: prismjs → refractor → react-refractor → @sanity/ui → sanity
- **Fix**: Added PrismJS override to package.json
- **Resolution**: Forced PrismJS to version ^1.30.0 without breaking Sanity dependencies

## Changes Made

### package.json
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "prismjs": "^1.30.0"
  }
}
```

### Dependencies Updated
- Next.js: ^15.3.2 → 15.3.5 (security patch)
- PrismJS: Forced to ^1.30.0 via override
- brace-expansion: Fixed via dependency resolution

## Verification
- ✅ `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ Project compiles successfully  
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ All fixes applied without downgrading major dependencies

## Commit Details
- **Branch**: `cursor/fix-vulnerability-in-isolate-branch-bd81`
- **Commit**: `a85d0e2` - "fix: resolve security vulnerabilities"
- **Files Modified**: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`

## Approach Taken
Instead of applying the suggested breaking change (downgrading Sanity from v3.98.1 to v2.36.6), we used a dependency override to force PrismJS to the secure version. This approach:

1. Resolves all security vulnerabilities
2. Maintains compatibility with the current Sanity version
3. Avoids breaking changes that would require code modifications
4. Provides a clean, maintainable solution

The security fixes are now complete and ready for merge into the main branch.
